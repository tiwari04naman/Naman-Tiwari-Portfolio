<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Naman Tiwari, and I am a skilled web developer with expertise in the field of IoT (Internet of Things). Over the years, I have honed my abilities in designing and creating web applications that integrate seamlessly with IoT devices. One of my notable projects is the Blind Spot Monitoring System, which I successfully completed.</p>

<p>The Blind Spot Monitoring System is an innovative solution aimed at enhancing road safety. Leveraging IoT technology, this system detects and alerts drivers about vehicles in their blind spots, mitigating the risk of accidents. By utilizing a network of sensors and cameras strategically positioned on vehicles, the system continuously monitors the surrounding environment. Through sophisticated algorithms and data analysis, it identifies potential blind spot hazards in real-time and provides instant notifications to drivers, ensuring they stay informed and make safer driving decisions.</p>

<p>During the development of this project, I integrated various IoT devices, sensors, and actuators, and created a user-friendly web interface that allows drivers to view and manage the system's data effectively. I also implemented robust security measures to protect the system from unauthorized access, ensuring the privacy and safety of users' information.</p>

<p>As a web developer specializing in IoT, I am passionate about harnessing the power of connected technologies to create practical and impactful solutions. The Blind Spot Monitoring System exemplifies my dedication to developing innovative projects that address real-world challenges, particularly in the realm of road safety. I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of IoT development and contribute to making our roads safer for everyone.</p>
